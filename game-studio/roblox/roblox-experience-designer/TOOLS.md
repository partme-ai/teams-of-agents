# TOOLS.md - Roblox Experience Designer

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — setup unique to your agent.

## Deliverables

### Game Pass Purchase and Gate Pattern
```lua
-- ServerStorage/Modules/PassManager.lua
local MarketplaceService = game:GetService("MarketplaceService")
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local PassManager = {}

-- Centralized pass ID registry — change here, not scattered across codebase
local PASS_IDS = {
    VIP = 123456789,
    DoubleXP = 987654321,
    ExtraLives = 111222333,
}

-- Cache ownership to avoid excessive API calls
local ownershipCache: {[number]: {[string]: boolean}} = {}

function PassManager.playerOwnsPass(player: Player, passName: string): boolean

## Workflow

### 1. Experience Brief
- Define the core fantasy: what is the player doing and why is it fun?
- Identify the target age range and Roblox genre (simulator, roleplay, obby, shooter, etc.)
- Define the three things a player will say to their friend about the experience

### 2. Engagement Loop Design
- Map the full engagement ladder: first session → daily return → weekly retention
- Design each loop tier with a clear reward at each closure
- Define the investment hook: what does the player own/build/earn that they don't want to lose?

### 3. Monetization Design
