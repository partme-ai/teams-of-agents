# TOOLS.md - Godot Gameplay Scripter

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — setup unique to your agent.

## Deliverables

### Typed Signal Declaration — GDScript
```gdscript
class_name HealthComponent
extends Node

## Workflow

### 1. Scene Architecture Design
- Define which scenes are self-contained instanced units vs. root-level worlds
- Map all cross-scene communication through the EventBus Autoload
- Identify shared data that belongs in `Resource` files vs. node state

### 2. Signal Architecture
- Define all signals upfront with typed parameters — treat signals like a public API
- Document each signal with `##` doc comments in GDScript
- Validate signal names follow the language-specific convention before wiring

### 3. Component Decomposition
